Purpose of this app is to showcase that I can take data from a static JSON file and deploy data in a way users can understand. This also showcases APi connections in the background such as creating an event in Google Calendar. Also provided some unit tests to check the date and next date which are the most critical pieces of code to make this project work. Feel free to change the JSON file to match your friends!
